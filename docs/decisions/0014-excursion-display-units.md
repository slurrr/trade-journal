# 0014 – Excursion Display Units

## Decision
MAE/MFE/ETD are stored and displayed in absolute PnL units (quote currency), not as percentages.

## Rationale
Excursions are defined in terms of unrealized PnL and are most interpretable in the same units as trade PnL. Percentage views can be added later without changing the core metrics.

## Status
Provisional
