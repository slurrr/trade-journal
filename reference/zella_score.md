# Tradezella Zella Score Reference 

The TradeZella Zella Score is a single, comprehensive score (0-100) summarizing a trader's overall performance by combining six key metrics: Profit Factor, Avg Win/Loss, Win %, Max Drawdown, Recovery Factor, and Consistency, each weighted by importance, providing a balanced view of profitability, risk management, and habit stability beyond just P&L. It's calculated by TradeZella's software, which scores each metric (0-100) and combines them with specific weights (e.g., Profit Factor 25%, Max Drawdown 20%) to give traders an overall "report card" for improvement.

## Key Metrics in the Zella Score

- Profit Factor (25%): Total profits / Total losses (measures profitability).
- Max Drawdown (20%): Largest peak-to-trough decline (measures risk).
- Avg Win/Loss (20%): Average profit per win vs. average loss per loss (measures risk/reward).
- Trade Win % (15%): Percentage of winning trades (measures win rate).
- Recovery Factor (10%): Profit factor / Max drawdown (measures resilience).
- Consistency Score (10%): Tracks variation in daily performance (measures habit steadiness).

## How It's Calculated (Simplified)

- Individual Metric Scoring: TradeZella scores each of the six metrics (0-100) based on your trading data.
- Weighted Combination: These individual scores are then multiplied by their respective weightings (e.g., Profit Factor's score * 0.25).
- Summation: All weighted scores are added together to produce the final Zella Score, a single number reflecting overall trading quality.
